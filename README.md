# Apache-Hadoop

This article serves as a comprehensive exploration of the fundamental concepts of Apache Hadoop, originally developed as part of a semester assignment during my first year at university. In addition to the technical content, this article includes a reflective section titled "Reaction to Lecture Topics," which is a more philosophical part of the article, as it was required in our assignment.
